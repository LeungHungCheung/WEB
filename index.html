                <p class="dis">Leung Hung Cheung, born in Hong Kong, China, is an undergraduate student of creative media at City University of Hong Kong (CityU).<br> 
                    He first discovered his interest in art during his time at the Hong Kong Community College (HKCC). <br>
                    He is attracted by the beauty and diversity of the world in photography and films. <br>
                    This opportunity led him to decide to explore art more deeply by studying at an art school for his bachelor's degree.

                <p class="dis-1">
                    Before Leung Hung Cheung's art journey started, he had experienced failure in the HKDSE. To fix this career mistake, <br>
                    he tried his best to perform in the associate degree in engineering at HKCC from 2021 to 2023. During the period of his associate degree,<br>
                    he was awarded to the dean's list for one semester and used his high GPA to gain admission to the university. <br>
                    This experience shaped his understanding in the fields of engineering and mathematics, including electronic circuits, <br>
                    complex logical thinking, and physics. For now, he is studying hard at the School of Creative Media at CityU, <br>
                    aiming to produce excellent artwork that benefits society.

                <p class="dis-2">
                   Leung Hung Cheung's artwork consistently employs an approach rooted in everyday life. <br>
                   To find the tiny things in public's daily life and express his subjective idea about those phenomena. From micro to macro.<br>
                   His primary exploration themes will be related to technology, such as QR codes and social media trends. <br>
                   His process of creating artwork often begins with the tiny and everyday things from his personal life. <br>
                   And followed by some in-depth research by scholars to identify the critical issue.
